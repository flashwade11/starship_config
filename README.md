# Here is my configuration about starship


If you want to use my configuration, you can follow commands as below:
```shell
echo "export STARSHIP_CONFIG=~/.config/starship/starship.toml" >> ~/.zshrc
git clone git@github.com:flashwade11/starship_config.git ~/.config/starship/
source ~/.zshrc
```

Of course, you can change the location of configuration any where you like. Enjoy it!
